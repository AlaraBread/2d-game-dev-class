# moshing simulator
moshing simulator is a game that i made for dj's 2d game programming class. it is a rhythm game where the goal is to reach the end of the song while knocking as many people over as possible.

## controls
left click - jump
right click - use ability (if you have an active ability equipped)

## how to play
jump on the beat (there is an indicator that moves over your cursor in case you are unsure where the beat is). jump on secondary beats for extra points (secondary beats are the purple ones). your character will jump towards your mouse.

points that you earn ingame can be spent in the shop to buy powerups. you can also apply game modifiers that alter the way the game works from the mod menu.

## compiling on linux
run `make` in the root directory to compile.
`make run` will compile and run.
`make grind` will compile and run within callgrind.

no idea how to compile on anything other than linux.
